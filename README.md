# StockWatcher 
Build out a web app that accurately details information on numerous stocks and ETFs from the free Finnhub.io API. Front-end is the focus but back-end is well written and upgradable. Users will be able to view a multitude of information relating to stocks they choose to add to their “watchlist,” as well as non-watchlist stocks. Some of these include charts, buzz, news, opinions, and forecasts. The goal of the project is to create an upgradable web app that allows users to follow and gain knowledge of stocks they trade, follow, or are interested in.
